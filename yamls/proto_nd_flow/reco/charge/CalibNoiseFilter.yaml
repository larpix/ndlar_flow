# This class implements several filters to remove irregularities in data from LArPix bugs or configuration issues.

  #params specific to each cut
  low_current_filter__threshold: 6.0 #
  hot_pixel_filter__max_n_hits: 35 
    #hot_pixel_filter__max_n_hits: 
    # - maximum number of hits on a channel in single event before filtering all hits from channel
    # - 35 chosen by hand scanning events. in a 200us event, 35 hits corresponds to ~50% of the maximum data rate from a LArPix channel
    #
    # low_current_filter__threshold:
    # - minimum Q for filter
    # - 6 chosen from hand scanning, and to be ~1ke- above the mean 2x2 thresholds. This is currently crude, and this should be implemented in the future as a per-channel threshold.
